# cSEM: a package for composite-based SEM <img src='man/figures/cSEMsticker.svg' align="right" height="200" /></a>

[![CRAN
status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/cSEM)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cSEM)
[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.com/M-E-Rademaker/cSEM.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/M-E-Rademaker/cSEM)

WARNING: THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS. BREAKING CHANGES TO THE API ARE VERY
LIKELY. Use the package with caution and please report bugs to [the
package
developers](mailto:manuel.rademaker@uni-wuerzburg.de;f.schuberth@utwente.nl).
The first stable relase will be version 0.0.1, most likely in mid 2019.

## Purpose

Estimate, analyse, test, and study linear, nonlinear, hierachical
structural equation models using composite-based approaches and
procedures, including estimation techniques such as partial least
squares path modeling (PLS-PM) and its derivatives (PLSc, OrdPLSc,
robustPLSc), generalized structured component analysis (GSCA),
generalized structured component analysis with uniqueness terms (GSCAm),
generalized canonical correlation analysis (GCCA), principal component
analysis (PCA), factor score regression (FSR) using sum score,
regression or bartlett scores (including bias correction using Croon’s
approach), as well as several tests and typical postestimation
procedures (e.g., verify admissibility of the estimates, assess the
model fit, test the model fit, compute confidence intervals, compare
groups, etc.).

## Installation

``` r
# Currently only a development version from GitHub is available:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("M-E-Rademaker/cSEM")
```

## Getting started

The best place to get started is the
[cSEM-website](https://m-e-rademaker.github.io/cSEM/) (Work in
progress).

## Philosophy

  - Above all: user-centered design\!
  - Easy to use by non-R experts:
      - One central function `csem()` provides default choices for most
        of its arguments (similarity to the `sem()` and `cfa()`
        functions of the [lavaan](http://lavaan.ugent.be/) package is
        intended).
      - Well documented (vignettes, HTML output, a website, (eventually)
        intro course(s) and cheatsheets)
      - Structured output/results that aims to be “easy”" in a sense
        that it is
          - … descriptive/verbose
          - … (eventually) easy to export to other environments such as
            MS Word, Latex files etc. (exportability)
          - … (eventually) easy to migrate from/to/between other
            PLS/VB/CB-based systems (lavaan, semPLS, ADANCO, SmartPLS)
  - The package is designed to be flexible/modular enough so that
    researchers developing new methods can take specific function
    provided by the package and alter them according to their need
    without working their way through a chain of other functions
    (naturally this will not always be possible). Modularity is largly
    inspired by the `matrixpls` package.
  - Modern in a sense that the package integrates modern developments
    within the R community. This mainly includes
    ideas/recommendations/design choices that fead into the packages of
    the [tidyverse](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse).
  - State of the art in a sense that we seek to quickly implement recent
    methodological developments in composite-based SEM.

## Basic usage

The basic usage is illustrated below.

<img src="man/figures/api.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Roughly speaking using `cSEM` is always the same 3 step procedure

> 1.  Pick a dataset and specify a model using [lavaan
>     syntax](http://lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/syntax1.html)
> 2.  Use `csem()`
> 3.  Apply one of the postestimation functions listed below on the
>     resulting object.

## Postestimation functions

Currently we have five major postestimation verbs.

  - `assess()` : assess the model using common fit and assessment
    measures
  - `infer()` : calculate common inferencial quantities (e.g, standard
    errors)
  - `predict()` : predict indicator values (not yet implemented)
  - `summarize()` : summarize the results
  - `verify()` : verify admissibility of the estimates

Tests are performed by using the test family of functions. Currently the
following tests are implemented.

  - `testOMF()` : performs a test for overall model fit
  - `testMICOM()` : performs a test for composite measurement invariance
  - `testMGD` : performs several test to assess multi-group differences
  - `testHausman()` : performs the regression-based Hausam test to test
    for endogeneity.

All functions require a `cSEMResults` object.

## Example

Models are defined using [lavaan
syntax](http://lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/syntax1.html) with some slight
modifications. For illustration we use the build-in and well-known
`satisfaction` dataset.

``` r
require(cSEM)
data(satisfaction)
    
## Note: The operator "<~" tells cSEM that the construct to its left is modelled
##       as a composite.
##       The operator "=~" tells cSEM that the construct to its left is modelled
##       as a common factor.
##       The operator "~" tells cSEM which are the dependent (left-hand side) and
##       independent variables (right-hand side).
    
model <- "
# Structural model
EXPE ~ IMAG
QUAL ~ EXPE
VAL  ~ EXPE + QUAL
SAT  ~ IMAG + EXPE + QUAL + VAL 
LOY  ~ IMAG + SAT

# Composite model
IMAG <~ imag1 + imag2 + imag3
EXPE <~ expe1 + expe2 + expe3 
QUAL <~ qual1 + qual2 + qual3 + qual4 + qual5
VAL  <~ val1  + val2  + val3

# Reflective measurement model
SAT  =~ sat1  + sat2  + sat3  + sat4
LOY  =~ loy1  + loy2  + loy3  + loy4
"
```

Estimation is conducted by the `csem()` function.

``` r
# Estimate using defaults
res <- csem(.data = satisfaction, .model = model)

# This is equal to
csem(
   .data                        = satisfaction,
   .model                       = model,
   .approach_cor_robust         = "none",
   .approach_nl                 = "sequential",
   .approach_paths              = "OLS",
   .approach_weights            = "PLS-PM",
   .conv_criterion              = "diff_absolute",
   .disattenuate                = TRUE,
   .dominant_indicators         = NULL,
   .estimate_structural         = TRUE,
   .id                          = NULL,
   .iter_max                    = 100,
   .normality                   = FALSE,
   .PLS_approach_cf             = "dist_squared_euclid",
   .PLS_ignore_structural_model = FALSE,
   .PLS_modes                   = NULL,
   .PLS_weight_scheme_inner     = "path",
   .reliabilities               = NULL,
   .starting_values             = NULL,
   .tolerance                   = 1e-05,
   .resample_method             = "none", 
   .resample_method2            = "none",
   .R                           = 499,
   .R2                          = 199,
   .handle_inadmissibles        = "drop",
   .user_funs                   = NULL,
   .eval_plan                   = "sequential",
   .seed                        = NULL,
   .sign_change_option          = "none"
    )
```

The result is always an object of class `cSEMResults`. Technically, the
resulting object has at least one additional class attribute (namely
`cSEMResults_default`, `cSEMResults_multi` or `cSEMResults_2ndorder`),
however, users usually do not need to care about since postestimation
functions (will eventually) automatically work on all classes.

``` r
## Access elements using `$`. E.g.:
res$Estimates$Loading_estimates 
res$Information$Model
    
## Examine the structure:
listviewer::jsonedit(res, mode = "view") # requires the listviewer package.
    
## Get a summary
summarize(res) 
    
## Apply postestimation functions, e.g.
verify(res) 
    
## Test overall model fit
testOMF(res)

## Assess the model
assess(res)
```

#### Inference

By default no inferential quantities are calculated since most
composite-based estimators have no closed-form expressions for standard
errors. Some closed form standard error are implemented, however, this
feature is still rather preliminary. It is therefore recommoned to use
resampling instead. `cSEM` mostly relies on the `bootstrap` procedure
(although `jackknife` is implemented as well) to estimate standard
errors, test statistics, and critical quantiles.

`cSEM` offers two ways to compute resamples:

1.  Setting `.resample_method` to `"jackkinfe"` or `"bootstrap"` and
    subsequently using postestimation functions `summarize()` or
    `infer()`.
2.  The same result is achieved by passing a `cSEMResults` object to
    `resamplecSEMResults()` and subsequently using postestimation
    functions `summarize()` or `infer()`.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
# Setting `.resample_method`
b1 <- csem(.data = satisfaction, .model = model, .resample_method = "bootstrap")
b2 <- resamplecSEMResults(res)
```

Several resample-based confidence intervals are implemented, see
`?infer()`:

``` r
summarize(b1)
infer(b1, .quantity = c("CI_standard_z", "CI_percentile")) # no print method yet
```

Both bootstrap and jackknife resampling support platform-independent
multiprocessing as well as setting random seeds via the [future
framework](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future). For
multiprocessing simply set `.eval_plan = "multiprocess"` in which case
the maximum number of available cores is used if not on Windows. On
Windows as many separate R instances are opened in the backround as
there are cores available instead. Note that this naturally has some
overhead so for a small number of resamples multiprocessing will not
always be faster compared to sequential (single core) processing (the
default). Seeds are set via the `.seed` argument.

``` r
b <- csem(
  .data            = satisfaction,
  .model           = model, 
  .resample_method = "bootstrap",
  .R               = 999,
  .seed            = 98234,
  .eval_plan       = "multiprocess")
```
